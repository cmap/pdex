<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What is a PDEx score?</li>
		<ul><li>A precentile measure of the strength of association between sample set and CMap perturbagen compared to an empircal background. Range is -100 to 100. Scores > |90| beat out 90% of background connections and are considered strong.</li></ul>
	<li>How do I interpret a heatmap on the gene page?</li>
		<ul><li>Columns represent different sample sets from alterations in the given gene. Rows represent CMap perturbagens. The value in a cell is the PDEx score for association between the sample set and the CMap pert. The default scheme colors all strong connections (> |90|). A tutorial on the features of the morpheus heatmap viewer is available <a href="https://clue.io/morpheus/tutorial.html">here.</a> </li></ul>
